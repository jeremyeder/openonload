Building and installation
-------------------------
To build a binary RPM for the running kernel type:
 
  rpmbuild --rebuild <source rpm filename>
 
To install the resulting binary rpm:
 
  Locate the file that was created in the preceding step, prefixed with the
  annotation "Wrote:", then type:
 
  rpm -Uvh <binary rpm filename>
 
To ensure that the correct version of the driver is loaded into the current
kernel
   /sbin/modprobe -r sfc
   /sbin/modprobe sfc
  
Installation of the driver can be confirmed by typing:
   modinfo sfc | grep version
and checking for the line:
   version: 4.0.2.6628

All network interfaces available on the system can be found with:
  ifconfig -a


Driver updates
--------------
The latest version of this driver can always be downloaded from

Changelog
---------

### v4.0.2.6628 - Feature release

Add support for RX time-stamping and PTP on SFN7XXX family adapters:
   ~ This release provides the driver support necessary for both the 
     Solarflare Enhanced PTP daemon ("sfptpd") and linuxptpd which is 
     provided in some distributions.

Issue 37568:
  ~ Properly deliver VLAN-tagged PTP packets when disabling PTP.
Issue 39894:
  ~ Fix DMA unmapping of incorrect addresses for TSO TX buffers on SFN7XXX
    family adapters.
    This bug would be observed as unmap page errors, and would affect users with
    TSO (enabled by default) and an IOMMU enabled.
Issue 38352:
  ~ Remove build time warning message when MTD is disabled, as sfutils can now
    work on linux using an IOCTL to the driver.


### v4.0.0.6585 - Feature release

Support for SFN7XXX family adapters (using SFC91XX family silicon):
  ~ This release contains full GA quality support for the new SFN7XXX series of
    network adapters.
  ~ Currently running PTP on SFN7XXX adpaters is not supported. This support
    will be in a subsequent release in 2013Q4.
  ~ There are new counters exposed via "ethtool -S" to expose any new internal
    packet counters.
  ~ driver support for the "sfkey" utility to modify feature licenses on the
    adpater.

TX improvements:
  ~ Support for SFC91XX TX PIO (Programmed IO) feature for lower TX latency.
    This is controlled by the new module parameter "piobuf_size" (default on
    x86 is 256 bytes). For frames that are smaller than this, and if there are
    adapter resources available, a packet will be transfered directly to the
    adapter via PIO rather than incur the latency of a bus mastered DMA. 

RX improvements:
  ~ The driver now uses a single optimized RX buffer allocation strategy
    (the "rx_alloc_method" module parameter has been deprecated and has no
    effect other than to print a warning).
  ~ Use memory more efficiently by supporting RX scatter for large MTU values
  ~ Make initial fill of RX descriptors synchronous. This is to avoid a non-zero
    "rx_nodesc_drops" count which could previously increment during driver load
    when there was incoming traffic.

Support for POWER systems, including:
  ~ AER/EEH support in the net driver
  ~ Improve performance by reusing DMA-mapped pages
  ~ Improve performance by allocating RX buffers more efficiently in pages of
    memory

Ethtool offline self-test behaviour for SFN7XXX:
  ~ For SFN7XXX series adapters the ethtool offline selftest (which can be used
    to verify hardware operation) can cause operations on other network
    interfaces on the same adapter to fail (as the whole adapter goes into a
    test mode). Only run the ethtool offline self-test on one port at a time,
    and expect to see loss of link for the duration of the test on all ports.
    Note the ethtool online test does not have this limitation.

Issue 39031:
  ~ Remove ethtool RESET operation that could be used by an unpriviledged local
    user to cause a local denial of service.
Issue 31933:
  ~ Cancel interrupt self-test on interface-down on Linux <2.6.23
Issue 36071:
  ~ Avoid kernel warning in skb_try_coalesce
Issue 34973:

Issue 16820:
  ~ Detach network device during reconfiguration to avoid TX watchdog event
Issue 34335:
  ~ Fix driver load failure due to symbols exported on some kernel versions



### v3.3.3.6329 -- Update release
Issue 38482:
  ~ Fix issue in dealing with multicast mismatch present in v3.3.0.6262, which
   was caused by the fix for Issue 31533. This could cause old packet data to
   be received (and hence could look like packet loss, or out-of-order
   packets).

   The bug hits when the following events coincide:
    1) The arrival of a frame that is discarded by the driver.
    2) The receiving channel is in "page-mode" for RX buffer allocation.
    3) The previous packet received has been consumed and freed.

   By default the RX allocation mode is selected automatically by the
   driver according to the traffic profile, and will prefer page-mode when
   packets that can be handled by kernel GRO dominate.

   A workaround for affected drivers is to set the driver parameter
   "rx_alloc_method=1" (to force SKB based allocations).
