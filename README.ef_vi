ef_vi
=====

 ef_vi is an API that gives applications access to the network adapter's
 datapath.  That is, it can be used to send and receive raw Ethernet frames
 directly from user-level.  The advantage of using this interface is that
 it incurs very little CPU overhead, and so yields the best possible
 performance.

 ef_vi is a zero-copy interface.  This means that the user gets direct
 access to the buffers in memory that the hardware uses, avoiding a copy
 that is usually incurred by higher-level interfaces.  Zero copy can be a
 big win for applications that:

   - have very high throughput requirements, or
   - are filtering received data, or
   - are forwarding data.

 The downside of using ef_vi is that you have to implement the upper-layer
 protocols yourself, including IP, UDP, TCP etc.  It is relatively
 straighforward to use ef_vi for UDP, but much more difficult for TCP which
 is very complex to implement from scratch.  (Best to leave that to
 OpenOnload!).  ef_vi can be used in an application at the same time as
 OpenOnload, so an application might use ef_vi for some especially
 performance sensitive UDP traffic, and sockets with OpenOnload for TCP and
 other traffic.

 ef_vi is included in the OpenOnload distribution, and is used by the
 OpenOnload user-level sockets library to access the hardware's datapath.


Overview
========

 Users of ef_vi must first allocate a virtual interface (VI), encapsulated
 by the type "ef_vi".  A VI includes:

   - A receive descriptor ring.  (For receiving packets).
   - A transmit descriptor ring.  (For sending packets).
   - An event queue.

 To transmit a packet, the application writes the packet contents
 (including all headers) into one or more packet buffers, and calls
 ef_vi_transmit().  One or more descriptors that describe the packet are
 queued in the transmit ring, and a doorbell is "rung" to tell the NIC that
 the transmit ring is ready.

 To receive, descriptors (each identifying a buffer) are queued in the
 receive ring by calling ef_vi_receive_init() and _post().  When packets
 arrive at the network adapter and are directed to a VI, they are written
 into the buffers in fifo order.

 The event queue is a channel from the NIC to software which notifies
 software when packets arrive from the network, and when transmits complete
 (so that the buffers can be freed or reused).  The application retrieves
 these events by calling ef_eventq_poll().

 The buffers used for packet data are special: They must be pinned so that
 they cannot be paged, and they must be registered for DMA using an
 ef_memreg.

 The NIC uses a special address space to identify locations in registered
 memory, and such addresses are designated by the type "ef_addr".
 Protection domains (ef_pd) provide an address space for registered memory.
 All VIs allocated against a given protection domain can access any memory
 registered within that protection domain.

 Filters are the means by which the NIC decides where to deliver packets it
 receives from the network.  By default all packets are delivered to the
 kernel network stack.  Filters are added by the application to direct
 received packets to a given VI.

 You can request a protection domain be associated with an SR-IOV virtual
 function (VF).  This allows more memory to be registered.  Latency and
 packet rate are slightly worse when using VFs due to address translations
 in the system IOMMU.  See the Solarflare Server Adapter User's Guide for
 details of how to enable SR-IOV.

 It is also possible to use physical addressing.  This mode gives the best
 latency and allows unlimited amounts of memory to be registered.  However,
 an application using physical addressing can cause the network adapter to
 read and write arbitrary host memory, and so breaks the system security
 model.


Documentation
=============

 The ef_vi documentation is generated by doxygen from the relevant
 source files.  To create this, install doxygen, and then run:

  cd src/include/etherfabric/doxygen
  doxygen doxyfile_ef_vi

 This will generate HTML, RTF, and LaTex documents in the relevant
 subdirectory.  That latter can be processed to create a PDF if
 necessary.

 There is also a set of sample applications, which are located at:

   openonload/src/tests/ef_vi

 If you've any questions please contact <support@solarflare.com>.


Compiling and linking
=====================

 Applications or libraries using ef_vi will need to include the header
 files in src/include/etherfabic/

 The application will need to be linked with libciul1.a or libciul.so,
 which can be found under the "build" directory after running
 scripts/onload_build or scripts/onload_install.
