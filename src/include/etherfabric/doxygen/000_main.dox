Solarflare's %ef_vi API is a flexible interface for passing Ethernet 
frames between applications and the network. It is the internal API used 
by Onload for sending and receiving packets.

\section introduction Introduction

%ef_vi grants an application direct access to the Solarflare network 
adapter datapath to deliver lower latency and reduced per message 
processing overheads. It can be used directly by applications that want 
the very lowest latency send and receive API, and that do not require a 
POSIX socket interface.

The key features of %ef_vi are:
- __User-space:__ Ef_vi can be used by unprivileged user-space applications.
- __Kernel bypass__: Data path operations do not require system calls.
- __Low CPU overhead__: Data path operations consume very few CPU cycles.
- __Low latency__: Suitable for ultra-low latency applications.
- __High packet rates__: Supports millions of packets per second per core.
- __Zero-copy__: Particularly efficient for filtering and forwarding
  applications.
- __Flexibility__: Supports many use cases (see \ref use_cases).
- __Redistributable__: %ef_vi is free software distributed under a LGPL
  license.

Each %ef_vi instance provides a \ref vi for an application to use:

- Each virtual interface provides a TX channel for passing packets to the 
  adapter. Packets may be transmitted onto the wire, or looped-back in the 
  adapter for delivery back into the host, or both.

- Each virtual interface also provides an RX channel for receiving packets
  from the adapter. These can be packets received from the wire, or
  looped-back from the TX path.
