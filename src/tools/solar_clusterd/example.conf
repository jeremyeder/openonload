; CaptureInterface is a required property and be specified just once

; CaptureStream is a required property can be specified multiple
; times to capture multiple streams.

; ProtectionMode is optional.  If not specified, default is
; EF_PD_DEFAULT.  Allowed options can be looked up in
; onload/src/include/etherfabric/pd.h

; We also support multi line properties like below

; CaptureMode is optional.  The default is 'steal'.  You can also set
; it to 'sniff'.  Currently, only 'all' CaptureStream can be sniffed.

; Promiscuous is optional.  The default is 1.  It does not have any
; affect if CaptureMode is not specified.  If CaptureMode is
; specified, then this dictates whether promiscuous mode is enabled or
; not.

; You can set options on CaptureStream globally or individually.  For
; example, in the following, CaptureMode of 'steal' is applied to all
; unnumbered streams whereas the CaptureMode of 'sniff' is only
; applied to CaptureStream 1.  Note that the numbered streams can only
; have positive numbers.

CaptureStream   = dhost=239.1.2.3,dport=12345,udp
